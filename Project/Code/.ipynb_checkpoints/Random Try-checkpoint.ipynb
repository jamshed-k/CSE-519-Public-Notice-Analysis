and  e. neither party shall owe the other child support.  5. on or about october 12  2015  i entered into an agreement with father to modify my parenting time to weekends only from friday evening through monday morning.  6. on or about november 30  2015  i relocated to oregon to be with my husband  who was transferred to oregon by his employer.  7. on or about february 11  2016  i entered into a new agreement with father to modify my parenting time to a long-distance plan.  8. pursuant to that february 11  2016 agreement  i was awarded two weeks each summer  every spring and fall break  and meaningful time with my son anytime i return to arizona  upon one-week written notice to father.  9. on or about november 4  2016  i informed father that i was returning to arizona temporarily through march 2017.  10. since my return to arizona  father has allowed me to have 9 days with my son.  11 father denied all of my subsequent  reasonable requests to visit with my son.  12. i have not seen my son at all since november 26  2016.  13. i did not get to see my son for christmas or new yearâ€™s.  14. i have been allowed telephone contact with my son on sundays at 7 p.m.  but i am lucky if the calls last more than 3 minutes because my son seems very distracted during each call.  15. my son tells me he does not want to talk to me because father is playing a board game with him or watching a movie with him.  16. my son has told me that fatherâ€™s significant other instructed him to call her â€œmomâ€ and to refer to my newborn daughter as his step-sister  not his sister   17. my son also blamed me for some kind of disciplinary issue he had with his â€œcoach â€ but i have no knowledge of what the disciplinary issue is or that my son participates in any activity where he might have a coach.  18. i am afraid that father might be instructing our son to repeat these statements to me.  19. since our consent decree was entered  father has made decisions without my knowledge or consent.  20. on or about october 25  201 6  i learned that father changed my sonâ€™s school without informing me.  21. on or about march 30  2016  i discovered father moved to a new address without informing me.  22. on or about november 4  2016  i requested my sonâ€™s medical records  but father did not have me listed as our childâ€™s mother.  23. fatherâ€™s significant other constantly interferes in my co-parenting relationship with father   24  father has also forced me to communicate with his significant other about co- parenting issues that he and i should be discussing.  25. on or about january 10  2017  my husband and i learned that we will be moving back to arizona on a permanent basis.  26. i promptly informed father of the change in circumstance and requested that we revert to an equal parenting time arrangement  27. father is only willing to allow me to see my son on weekends pursuant to our october 12  2015 agreement.  28. father has still not allowed me to see my son and believes that i am at his mercy because he was told that our parenting plan cannot be modified until march 2017.  29. i am afraid that fatherâ€™s unreasonable actions are alienating me from my son and returning to weekend parenting â€˜time only is contrary to our sonâ€™s best interests.  30. for all of the foregoing reasons  i believe that my son is being harmed psychologically  morally and emotionally under fatherâ€™s care and that both legal decision-making and parenting time need to be modified as soon as possible  even though our parenting time was last modified ten and one-half months ago.  patricia marie chase.  by:  s  patricia marie chase  subscribed and sworn to before me this 24th day of january  2017.   s  michael jeanes  clerk  b. coldwellâ€™  deputy clerk  my commission expires:  exhibit a  publish peoria times  march 10  17 and 24  2017\n",

to order. present were edward delone  ella hamilton  guienzy brent  glenn todd and sam hanagriff. absent: adrienne kramer evans and susan dorsey  attorney. also present was jean paul pellerin  city building official for the city of franklin.    chairperson delone led the room in the pledge of allegiance.    a motion was made by ms. hamilton to accept the minutes of the january 26  2016 meeting  ms. brent seconded  and the motion carried.    mr. pellerin asked the commission to expand the agenda to include the applications of mr.  david popkin and mr. herman depass  both roof replacements. mr. hanagriff made a motion to expand the agenda to include these two applications  ms. brent seconded  and the motion carried.    applications:  a. david popkin  633 second street  franklin la - mr. aldon mayon approached the podium on behalf of mr. popkin. the existing roof has been there since 1990 and is leaking. he wants a new roof  replacing three-tab shingles with architectural shingles. no trim or woodwork will be covered or changed. mr. todd made a motion approving the application  ms. brent seconded  and the motion carried.  b. herman depass  615 trowbridge  franklin la - mr. depass approached the podium to present his application. he wants to replace the existing tin roof with another tin roof. mr. todd stated that it had to be the 26 gauge and no existing wood could be covered with the metal. mr. depass agreed. mr. hanagriff made a motion approving the application  ms. brent seconded  and the motion carried. mr. depass asked to discuss his property at 500 first street. he was advised that he could stay and talk about it at the end of the agenda  and he agreed.  c. gerald hulin  ace bail bonds  506 second street  franklin la - ms. nancy hulin approached the podium to present the application. she wanted to erect a sign that meets with historic district commission approval which is for ace bail bonds right next door to the jail. she wanted to know what the requirements were. mr. todd said he could send a link to the franklin guidelines on signs or she could get them from the city. mr. todd remembered that mr. hulin had been before the commission in the past but doesn't remember where it was left off; perhaps he was going for too large a sign. mr. todd said he would be willing to work with the hulins on the style and size of the sign. then they would have to make another application to come before the historic district commission stating they are applying to have a sign installed. ms. hulin agreed. mr. pellerin stated that this was a business in the historic district operating as a home occupation; no public can go onsite and it's not approved by the fire marshal. ms. hulin agreed. mr. pellerin further stated that to put the sign up  it would have to be pre-approved before the commission  and then go to zoning and the fire marshal to have that business approved. ms. hulin said she understood there was a procedure they had to go through. mr. todd said that if she wanted to know first what kind of sign and size she could have or any questions before she goes through the other steps  the commission was here to help with that. mr. todd stated that if she had any other questions besides the sign  she could ask those now as the commission had the application before it. ms. hulin said the sign  and she wanted the look to be conducive to the historic district. mr. todd stated that if she wanted to change the facade or add a fence or change a door  she would have to come back before the commission. ms. hulin agreed but said there were no other changes they have planned except putting a sign. mr. delone said the only thing the commission was entertaining now was the sign  and ms. hulin said that was correct. mr. todd asked if he had her permission to go and measure  and she said yes. he gave her a business card and said after he drew up the size and look of the sign  he would email ms. hulin the examples. mr. todd said that once he and ms. hulin got the sign designed  then they would have to bring it before the commission to get it approved. ms. hulin said she understood. ms. brent asked if it was the consensus of the commission that the procedure brought to the table is what the commission is in agreement to. mr. delone said he was just going to say that; that the commission needed to discuss this because they don't act alone. he said mr. todd said the right tiling about bringing it back to the commission. ms. hamilton asked if the commission hadn't gone through this before with this property. mr. todd said we are not here to decide zoning. ms. hulin acknowledged it was strictly the sign. mr. delone told her that it was already documented what size the sign should be; then the commission would get together and would assign someone to help her with the sign. ms. hulin said that's what mr. todd was indicating. ms. brent said it had to be a consensus of the commission that mr. todd take the lead in working with ms. hulin on the appropriateness of the sign. mr. pellerin said once a design is made  then she would come before the commission and they would vote on the sign. ms. hulin again said she was clear on that and understood. mr. delone said any other questions she had could come back before the commission or go before zoning.  d. craig thomson  gmbt llc  401 second street  franklin la - ms. kay louviere  approached the podium on behalf of mr. thomson. she stated there was a fire recently at 401 second street  and they would like to demolish the building  clean off the lot  and sell the lot or build a house on it to rent. there used to be a rental in the back and mr. thomson used the front for storage. there was a bid submitted on what it would cost to repair the building and it's not worth it. so they would like to demolish the building. mr. delone asked if everyone had looked at it. mr. pellerin asked if there were any questions. mr. hanagriff stated he had looked at the building  talked to mr. thomson  and it was structurally bad and would be condemned before too long  so there is really no other way to go but to demolish it. discussion ensued about it being economically unfeasible to repair  and for safety reasons it needed to be cleaned up. mr. hanagriff made a motion to approve the application  mr. todd seconded  and the motion carried.  e. diane and gary wiltz  710 first street  franklin la - mr. tim baudoin approached the podium on behalf of dr. and mrs. wiltz. mr. delone stated he had talked to dr. wiltz who stated that he had a previous engagement and could not be at this meeting. mr. baudoin stated the wiltzes had eight things on the list. he asked and was told to go down the list one at a time.  1  install an awning canopy on front gable windows  and they wanted to go with copper on the top on the front of the house over all three windows. there was a picture attached to the application. this will be one single awning all the way across  but the picture shows it over just one window as an illustration. mr. todd asked if that could be drawn out by whoever is selling them the awning  and mr. baudoin said it could. mr. todd suggested that maybe the commission come back to that because he was concerned  if the commission was in agreement based on this illustration  that it might not be aesthetically correct. discussion ensued about how the three windows would fit under the awning.  mr. hanagriff made a motion to postpone this item pending submitted drawings  mr. todd seconded  and the motion to postpone earned.  2  install victorian trim on the driveway side over the gable end  and that would be on the front as well as the side of the garage. a drawing was attached to the application. mr. hamilton made a motion to accept the item on the application  ms. brent seconded  and the motion carried.  3  repair a small amount of molding and to paint the house. mr. delone asked if there were any questions on this item. ms. brent made a motion to accept this item on the application  ms. hamilton seconded  and the motion carried.  4  roofing on the bay window. they want to put a metallic copper r panel on top of the bay window. mr. todd asked if the roof would be curved  and mr. pellerin asked if it was now a curved roof. mr. baudoin said he would rebuild it straight. mr. todd said that was a problem when you start to change things like that. that is a unique piece of history when it's curved like it is. to put that r panel straight  the wiltzes are doing themselves a disservice and are losing value on this house. mr. hanagriff said they would allow the curved roof instead of just straight. mr. baudoin said they didn't want to put copper because they didn't want the green after it turned  and he said maybe they could find a fish scale metal that color. mr. pellerin asked if this was financially unfeasible  would the commission allow them to go back with shingles like what's already there? mr. hanagriff said they could retain what's there. mr. baudoin said if they go back with architectural shingles  they would go back with like what's there. mr. hanagriff said he liked what they're doing  but he agreed with mr. todd that taking the curve out is changing the look. mr. baudoin stated he would need to talk to the wiltzes about staying with architectural shingles with a cap  but it needed to be done quickly. mr. delone told mr. baudoin that if they wanted to stay with the shingles  that wouldn't be a problem. ms. brent said she felt it was the wiltzes' decision. mr. todd made a motion to table number 4  ms. brent seconded  and the motion to table carried.  5  the palladium window in the back is exactly like the one on the side  and the wiltzes are asking to bring the back one to the side to double those windows and join them together  and get rid of the two side lights. the window in the back is an original window. mr. baudoin confirmed that it was visible from the street  and that he was going to wall over where the window was removed in the back. a discussion ensued on the visibility of the windows and the configuration of the newly placed windows. ms. hamilton made a motion to accept this item on the application  mr. todd seconded  and the motion carried.  6  moving the window from the back of the house to the gable in the garage  and removing the window that's currently there. mr. baudoin said that when you looked at the side of the house  you would see the two palladium windows. mr. todd said that those didn't match the rest of the windows on that side of the house. lengthy discussion ensued on what's going to be moved and the reconfiguration of the placement of the windows on the garage. mr. todd said he thinks this item should be tabled  and have it drawn to scale on the side of the building showing the commission exactly what it will look like. mr. todd told mr. baudoin that if would send him the two pictures and tell him what the sizes were  that he could work out the drawing  if the commission agrees. mr. hanagriff made a motion to table the item pending a better drawing and mr. todd seconded. mr. delone called for a voice vote  and then asked for a roll call vote.  ayes: ms. hamilton  mr. todd  mr. hanagriff  nays: none.  abstained: ms. brent  absent: ms. evans  the motion to table number 6 on the application carried.  7  install a weathervane on the top of the gazebo on the front of the house  and a picture was attached to the application. mr. todd made a motion to accept this item on the application  mr. hanagriff seconded  and the motion carried  8  replace the lattice borders on the bottom of the house as existing. they're sitting on the ground and need to be raised. mr. hanagriff made a motion to accept this item on the application  ms. hamilton seconded  and the motion carried. mr. delone recapped this application by stating that nos. 1  4 and 6 were postponed or tabled  and nos. 2  3  5  7 and 8 passed. mr. todd asked mr. baudoin to send him the measurements and pictures  and mr. delone asked that they be sent to the commission. mr. pellerin suggested that mr. baudoin send him any further information or drawings on the tabled items and he would disseminate them to the commission members and set up another meeting. mr. delone concurred and said the commission could take it from there  and any decision wouldn't be on one member of the commission. mr. todd stated that he was just offering to help; he wasn't trying to surpass a commission meeting. mr. delone stated it was the perception of it; he wanted to make the process complete  and that the commission knew that mr. todd was honorable. mr. pellerin reiterated that regardless there would have to be another meeting with the pictures included in the packets.    mr. herman depass again took the podium to discuss 500 first street next to the fire station.  mr. pellerin stated that he had approached mr. depass about the gingerbread on the front of that house. discussion ensued about the state of the gingerbread  a source of possible state funding to mr. depass to make those repairs  and the door on the front of that house. mr. hamilton asked about the house at 310 martin luther king. mr. pellerin advised her it was going before the city council this month. ms. hamilton said she was afraid it was going to collapse. ms. brent said martin luther king property was no different than the domino property that was voted to be demolished. if it was a safety issue  that was no different than the other. mr. pellerin stated that the difference was if the council asked him to go assess a property to see if it needs to be condemned  and if it has gone beyond a certain ratio  it's not brought before the historic district to be repaired because it's that bad. that was what happened with the martin luther king property. it has to go through about a four and a half month legal process to have it legally demolished or force the owners to do something with it. ms. brent asked the difference between that property and the domino property. mr. pellerin said the difference is that one wants to tear down and the other one won't. mr. delone stated it was out of the commission's hands.    guests public comment: none  documentation forms: none.  unfinished business: none.  announcements: the next scheduled meeting will be march 22  2016  pending submitted applications .    a motion was made to adjourn by ms. brent  seconded by mr. hanagriff  and the motion carried.    approved on the 22nd day of march  2016.    attest:   s

madden announced this meeting will discuss traffic only. this meeting is for the council and constituents to ask questions. he welcomed mr. franckiewicz and mr. shields  the council’s attorneys  an opened the floor for council questions then constituent questions.  mrs. sica presented a powerpoint regarding the port marigny density plan  total residential acreage of 45.8. at every p&z meeting for the past year density concerns have been raised  yet the proposed density remains at the 416 housing units this number is more than double the number of housing units required under the tnd section of our cluro. under the cluro 8.5 the required density for tnd is 4 housing units per residential acreage. port marigny has 45.8 acres as stated on their master plan  so the total allowed density is 183 housing units. this is the number the city should use to determine whether or not to approve this development. for that matter under our cluro 4.3 we could further reduce the 183 number if we find it necessary to ensure adequate mitigation of potentially unfavorable impact. to evaluate density we have the guidelines of our comprehensive plan and the regulations of our cluro. first  under the comprehensive plan one of the key issues is for mandeville to retain our small town atmosphere. the plan specifically states that infill development particularly in older neighborhoods must be consistent with existing size and scale. port marigny’s high density development built within low density old mandeville does not satisfy this goal. the comprehensive plan goal 12.1 states that port marigny be developed at a density that does not introduce unacceptable levels of congestion to old mandeville  this has not been proven. the development agreement includes setting mile stone limits which demonstrates that there is a traffic problem. the comprehensive plan goal 12.1 requires primary access should be provided through mariner’s village this access has not been established  the only access is monroe. the comprehensive plan states that alternate travel routes be established to avoid traffic congestion from port marigny. these have not been established. as it was determined in the p&z meetings that widening monroe and or expropriating property from lambert for a cut through would not be acceptable. the comprehensive plan goal 12.9 requires redevelopment of mariners village in conjunction with the development of the pre-stressed site this also has not been established. currently mariners village has about 20 000 sq. ft. of vacant commercial space and she is unaware of any conjoined effort to revitalize. the comprehensive plan requires retention of greenbelts adjacent to the streets. port marigny fails to meet this requirement as it calls for parking along massena street which removes the greenbelt. the cluro’s purpose as stated on pg. 1 is to lessen congestion and overcrowding of land. the cluro states that residential development should be compatible with that which presently exists. specific to port marigny the cluro states a tnd must reflect the patterns of old mandeville. port marigny’ s proposed high density development predominantly made up of apartments and townhomes is not compatible with that which presently exist and reflect the historic patterns of old mandeville. port marigny’s apartments are not only higher than immediate surrounding areas like mariners village; they are higher than any other apartment complex in mandeville’s city limits. they are higher than chenier and chenier fronts hwy 190  a four lane highway. in fact the number of apartments and townhomes total 261  this number alone is higher than the total number required density of 183. it is important to note that this is the first time we are applying the tnd design sections of our cluro 8.5. port marigny is located in a truly unique sensitive area of mandeville with extremely limited access. old mandeville is low density  prone to flooding and has only a two lane 30mph monroe st for access; we can’t afford to get this wrong. the tnd design standard allows 183 housing units for a development of this size. to consider a number greater than 183 is a risk we should not take. if we approve too great of a density we will forever change the landscape of mandeville and we will sacrifice the quality of life for our mandeville residents. new golden shores  adjacent from port marigny has 80 acres with 160 housing units. port marigny has 77 acres  about 6 are water  with 416 housing units plus commercial. if we were to put port marigny within new golden shores. we would add to the already 160 houses: 200 apartments  56 townhomes  120 room hotel  117 boat slips  and 2 restaurants  11 000 sq. ft. and 56 000 sf of retail space with no access to east causeway. the only access would be monroe st. the comparison between chenier  located on 4 lane hwy 190  and port marigny is the following. chenier has 5.32 acres with 27 apartment units and 35 800 sq. ft. of commercial space. port marigny has less acreage  4.8 acres  et they are proposing more than double the apartments - 70 apartment units and 56 000 sf of commercial space  with monroe st as their only access. lastly the hotel comparison. port marigny has proposed a 120 room hotel which is larger than the 4 other hotels closest to mandeville on i-12 and hwy 190. holiday inn  comfort suites  holiday inn express and staybridge. they are all rather large 4 story hotels  none as big as what port marigny proposes. everyone talks about how they would like something similar to the southern hotel in covington  but the southern hotel has 40 rooms. in conclusion  in order to preserve the character of old mandeville  and protect the health safety and welfare of or residents. port marigny should only be developed if the density is 183 or less.  mr. muller commented the number of 4 per acre comes from cluro 8.5.2.1 which states the minimum density shall be at least 4 acre so the 183 number she is using is the least number of residents not the maximum. the cluro also states detached single family residential development shall not exceed 8 acre  excluding rights-of-way. attached residential development shall not exceed 24 acre and mixed use buildings shall not exceed 16 acre. port marigny does not exceed these limits and follows the guidelines of a tnd. mrs. sica is not saying port marigny exceeds these limits  they should be closer to the minimum. according to section 4.3 the council can reduce so it fits within the scale of the community. mr. muller has a map from the comprehensive plan which shows the neighborhood map for port marigny. it states the pre-stressed site is identified with mariner’s village and it promotes the redevelopment of both properties. they should be treated as one area close to the causeway  totally different area from old mandeville. mrs. sica stated the comprehensive plan is to be used as a guide  the cluro tnd section 8.5.1.2 states the tnd should reflect the historic development patterns of old mandeville. mr. muller stated the key feature in old mandeville is that it has a grid street system to allow for migration  port marigny is laid out in a grid pattern no cul-de-sacs. the architectural type follows the traditional styles. mrs. sica agrees with the architectural style but disagrees with the density. she appreciates the development but thinks it needs to fit within the community. the development is mostly apartment and townhomes which is not old mandeville. mr. muller stated it is similar to mariner’s village. there is nothing in the cluro that suggests if traffic is accommodated with the number of units that there is any reason the density should be any less than what the cluro permits. mrs. sica feels there is a potential for traffic issues  they saw this in every meeting. from the traffic meeting today along with the old mandeville redevelopment strategy from 2006 and the comprehensive plan all three mention the unfavorable impact on traffic from port marigny. mr. muller stated they have come up with a solution with a right and left turn lane from e causeway heading south. the problem with the intersection was accommodated. they will put up $300k towards improvements. mr. pulaski commented cluro 4.3.3.8 section 5 and section 10 states safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity  including traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed use and other uses reasonable and anticipated in the area. with the idea something might be going on in mariners village  we need to consider what else would be going on. he still has a concern with traffic and supports mrs. sica’s position on density. the core is higher than any other like density in mandeville. mr. muller has problems with the uses proposed in port marigny with the possibility of mariner’s village development. mr. muller cannot control mariner’s village but the traffic issue is monroe and e. causeway  the level of service eastbound causeway is level ”e” and it has never been resolved. mr. pulaski stated the development follows the rules but are more than double the minimum and less than half of the maximum. mr. muller stated they cannot afford to do the minimum  it would be like a failed mariner’s village. mrs. sica commented it is not the council’s job to make sure the developer makes money. just because it is large does not mean it will make money  look at what happened to pinnacle. the council is responsible to our citizens  their health  safety  and welfare and community aesthetics.  mr. keller asked if there is a number that density can be reduced to and still remain profitable. he understands the purpose of the apartments is to support the town center. could the development have less units but make them larger and nicer  it could be a success such as those on the lakefront. mr. oubre stated to diminish the density so it cannot self-sustain will result in a failure. he noted mrs. sica has been opposed to the project from the start. mrs. sica is not opposed to the project  just the proposed density of the development. mr. oubre stated it is not about density it is about the place  the streets. the apartments will be designated as condos but will be rented until they are established. if there is not enough density the retail will struggle. mr. keller stated so there is no room for negotiation. mr. oubre replied it will not succeed if you reduce the density  it just will not function. if the development is at mrs. sica’s numbers you will guarantee failure.  mr. madden opened the floor for comments. mr. pulaski inquired if we can forgo the 3 minute rule because constituents have expressed they are given only 3 minutes while port marigny has all the time they need. mr. madden stated the council follows robert’s rules of order but he does not have a problem with giving constituents more time.  mr. pat rosenow wanted to thank mr. pulaski for allowing them to speak longer. he is aware the developers are stating they are under the maximum  but appreciates mrs. sica’s comments that the density should be reduced. it should not be an automatic stamp because they have come under the maximum. the council needs to address the areas mentioned and they are sworn to protect the interests of the citizens. one factor is it should reflect the tenor of old mandeville yet now we hear it is ok because it is close to the causeway. the council has discretion and numbers are good guidelines but not the whole answer. you need to look at the factors mrs. sica has pointed out. they need to use their discretion and decide what is in the best interest of the community not the developer.  ms. saxs is concerned even at the minimum how can they guarantee success. she is worried that once everything is signed off  they will be able to do whatever they want and it is too late. mrs. sica stated in the developmental agreement the uses are special uses which does not go back to the council. she is proposing to adhere to the cluro and make this conditional use and therefore will come back to the council for approval. ms. saxs discussed smart growth and listed 11 violations she finds with the project and requests the developers to withdraw their application.  ms. claudia sullivan wanted to thank mrs. sica for her presentation and for representing the thoughts of many of the people of mandeville.  mr. brian rhinehart commented in the 2005 traffic study it recommended to widen monroe from massena to causeway. in 2015 a traffic study sated there was not mitigation required and was rejected because it was flawed and a second study was done. the last study recommended a right turn and left turn  so with three studies  you have three different recommendations. what study do you use?  mr. ernest burguieres stated the rpc’s current traffic study had a problem with data collection and will not start back until september with results in november. he wanted to agree with mrs. sica  the comprehensive plan is a suggestion  the cluro trumps the comprehensive plan. mariners village when it was first proposed had all these good things and that did not materialize and the city is left holding the bag.  mr. bill mccoy wanted to thank mrs. sica for her homework and he cannot imagine the traffic he would experience if the development passes as is.  mr. ellis stated there is some negotiation needed for density and we need to find the balance  he does believe the number needs to be lowered.. he thinks condos would be a better use than apartments but how long before they would be leased. some potential suggestions could be to add more parking in lieu of condos apts; is you remove the lease property that would lower the amount of units hopefully by 30-4-%; any ideas as to who would be the anchor for the commercial property.  mrs. sica stated realistically we need to reduce the density to 183 and not roll the dice. the council has the discretion to do this. there is one way in and one way out unless you want to widen monroe and expropriate property on lambert.  mr. madden had a question for mr. shields and mr. franckiewicz but wanted to remind everyone that we have three stand-alone meetings that are topic specific for port marigny and it will be on the next two council agendas. he might have a questions for them where they may not have the answer immediately  but would like their response at the next meeting. his question is regarding expropriation of the property on lambert. do you see anything that gives the city the right to expropriate land on lambert? right of way and widening the street is one thing  but what about expropriation of land. mr. franckiewicz says the power to expropriate comes constitutionally  then state law. the city has a general expropriation power for public purpose. it would take an ordinance then it would proceed to court where the property owner would have the right to challenge and have due process. mr. madden asked if the council could put a stipulation in the ordinance to prevent expropriation now or in the future? mr. franckiewicz would have to research this for the next meeting. mrs. sica states the developmental agreement sets milestone agreement until they reach that traffic number and she does not want to be tied to this.  mr. ren clark wanted to let the council know that in all of the p&z meeting the issue of expropriation was off the table. mrs. scott confirmed that was one of the p&z recommendations to the council. mr. madden wants to make sure this is legal and included in the council’s actions.  mr. brian rhinehart commented the reason why expropriation has come up again is because he heard the rpc links widening lambert st. as a direct result of port marigny.  ms. bev tobin is concerned with the safety especially regarding children and busses all going back and forth from the west side to the east side. monroe is it  she lives it and has a real concern about safety.  mr. pulaski wanted to ask mr. shields and mr. franckiewicz  in the cluro 4.3.3.11 it discusses the total number of votes it will take to grant deny. there is talk of a 4 5 majority under certain circumstances. what are these circumstances and can they clarify if we would be a 4 5 for this development rather than the standard majority.  mr. keller stated he is sympathetic to the property owners  they have a plan and they have followed the plan. the project has to succeed but he is concerned about traffic and density. mariners village did fail in part because of the approval of the initial development. how will traffic and density be with more development in mariners village. we need the development to be done right so it does not cripple old mandeville and monroe st. he is not sure how we get to the figures. he feels the traffic is an issue on e causeway and would like to see the projection of the traffic circle and how it will take care of existing and future projects. he does not want to put extra lanes on e causeway and then a study comes back to do a roundabout  he does not want to waste money. he would like any port marigny’ s money to go towards the traffic solution.  mr. madden stated he and the mayor met with the rpc and the study will be done on september 23rd with results in november.  mayor villere commented any contributions from this development will add to the total money the city  causeway commission to develop a traffic circle at causeway. they believe a traffic circle will work and if lambert st is used it will be for a more direct access to port marigny. also a right and left turn lane into port marigny is warranted. he will provide this information to the council and the applicant. also they are considering a traffic circle at e. causeway and massena. the cost for the traffic circle would be about $2.4 million. mr. pulaski is concerned if there is enough space for the circle. the mayor stated they will have to go into the right of way for a few properties. mr. madden stated if port marigny was approved and they have proposed the turn lanes  can this be changed to a traffic circle before construction begins. mr. monet stated the turn lanes in the developmental agreement were set as a monetary value and is not definitive until the rpc study has been completed.  mr. pulaski has about four pages of questions regarding the developmental agreement for mr. shields and mr. franckiewicz. mr. pulaski will discuss these with the attorneys prior to the 8 31 developmental agreement meeting.  mr. burguieres commented it is not the council’s job to solve the developer’s problem; it is not a simple mathematical issue. he urged the council to not lose ambiance by adding more traffic lanes  a similar issue was done on claiborne ave in new orleans. this is now under discussion to bring it back to the old condition. you cannot bring back ambiance. if a traffic circle solves their problem it is up to them to build  not the city. mr. keller stated they are not helping the development but thinks it is a good idea for mandeville and it needs to succeed. the regulations should not be so strict to prevent success; this is a concrete area which has been an eye store. if the city does decide to do a traffic circle maybe they can renegotiate money from port marigny.  mr. leonard rohrbough stated traffic alone is not a detriment to health and safety. the city has to help control the traffic. there are a lot of empty lots in mandeville so the traffic concern is not just for port marigny but for the whole. many subdivisions have contributed to the traffic  everyone has to help solve the problem. he encouraged the project to move forward.  ms. debbie saxs wanted to remind the council  years ago the city rejected al copeland’s compound  the church was denied  she has restrictions on her home. she does not understand why this development is any different.  mr. pat rosenow hopes the council will resist the strong argument that either everybody builds or no one builds. also  the understanding of the super majority vote. the ordinance was written to help resist these large proposed developments by requiring a super majority in certain instances. one such instance is if the development is adjoining to land zoned r-1. what is contiguous in this case  is it a street. they believe sharing a common boundary is contiguous and is consistent with the statutory intent. the other case requiring a super majority is with 20% petition of land owners. he hopes for a consensus because this is an important decision.  mrs. sica just commented she is not here to make sure the developers make money and she does not agree they would not make money if they complied with the tnd guidelines. if they can’t comply under the 8.5 guidelines maybe they need to ask to be rezoned.  mr. madden reminded everyone of the regular council meeting thursday at 6pm. on august 16th there will be a welcome meeting for the new police chief at the community center. the next port marigny meeting is the next night august 17th to discuss fill and environmental. mr. muller inquired if they were on the agenda this thursday  mr. madden replied yes. the 25th is another regular council meeting and the 31st is the next stand alone port marigny meeting.  mr. muller wanted to comment about the traffic studies. the cluro sets the jurisdiction of the traffic study .traffic inside a tnd is different than a regular suburban development. the traffic circle is not a new concept and they have agreed to pay $300k to the city to use how they wish. the cost for the two turn lanes would be about $500k.  mr. bill mccoy wants to understand the vote would be 4 5 to approve the project. mr. madden has asked a legal ruling on this matter.  mr. brian rhinehart said the capture rate has a sliding scale 30 on the upper end  5% lower lane. the number you use frequently depends upon the proximity to train  bus and taxi depot. all of which should not have been considered since none exist in mandeville.  adjournment  mr. pulaski made a motion to adjourn the meeting; this was seconded by mr. keller. the meeting adjourned at 8:10 p.m.   s  clay madden  council chairman   s  kristine scherer council

 b. father will make the final decision if the parents do not reach an agreement regarding any major medical decision  emphasis added ;  c. the parties shall share essentially equal parenting time as follows:  i. mother will have parenting time every sunday through tuesday;

and  e. neither party shall owe the other child support.  5. on or about october 12  2015  i entered into an agreement with father to modify my parenting time to weekends only from friday evening through monday morning.  6. on or about november 30  2015  i relocated to oregon to be with my husband  who was transferred to oregon by his employer.  7. on or about february 11  2016  i entered into a new agreement with father to modify my parenting time to a long-distance plan.  8. pursuant to that february 11  2016 agreement  i was awarded two weeks each summer  every spring and fall break  and meaningful time with my son anytime i return to arizona  upon one-week written notice to father.  9. on or about november 4  2016  i informed father that i was returning to arizona temporarily through march 2017.  10. since my return to arizona  father has allowed me to have 9 days with my son.  11 father denied all of my subsequent  reasonable requests to visit with my son.  12. i have not seen my son at all since november 26  2016.  13. i did not get to see my son for christmas or new yearâ€™s.  14. i have been allowed telephone contact with my son on sundays at 7 p.m.  but i am lucky if the calls last more than 3 minutes because my son seems very distracted during each call.  15. my son tells me he does not want to talk to me because father is playing a board game with him or watching a movie with him.  16. my son has told me that fatherâ€™s significant other instructed him to call her â€œmomâ€ and to refer to my newborn daughter as his step-sister  not his sister   17. my son also blamed me for some kind of disciplinary issue he had with his â€œcoach â€ but i have no knowledge of what the disciplinary issue is or that my son participates in any activity where he might have a coach.  18. i am afraid that father might be instructing our son to repeat these statements to me.  19. since our consent decree was entered  father has made decisions without my knowledge or consent.  20. on or about october 25  201 6  i learned that father changed my sonâ€™s school without informing me.  21. on or about march 30  2016  i discovered father moved to a new address without informing me.  22. on or about november 4  2016  i requested my sonâ€™s medical records  but father did not have me listed as our childâ€™s mother.  23. fatherâ€™s significant other constantly interferes in my co-parenting relationship with father   24  father has also forced me to communicate with his significant other about co- parenting issues that he and i should be discussing.  25. on or about january 10  2017  my husband and i learned that we will be moving back to arizona on a permanent basis.  26. i promptly informed father of the change in circumstance and requested that we revert to an equal parenting time arrangement  27. father is only willing to allow me to see my son on weekends pursuant to our october 12  2015 agreement.  28. father has still not allowed me to see my son and believes that i am at his mercy because he was told that our parenting plan cannot be modified until march 2017.  29. i am afraid that fatherâ€™s unreasonable actions are alienating me from my son and returning to weekend parenting â€˜time only is contrary to our sonâ€™s best interests.  30. for all of the foregoing reasons  i believe that my son is being harmed psychologically  morally and emotionally under fatherâ€™s care and that both legal decision-making and parenting time need to be modified as soon as possible  even though our parenting time was last modified ten and one-half months ago.  patricia marie chase.  by:  s  patricia marie chase  subscribed and sworn to before me this 24th day of january  2017.   s  michael jeanes  clerk  b. coldwellâ€™  deputy clerk  my commission expires:  exhibit a  publish peoria times  march 10  17 and 24  2017\n",
